# Medicare_and_medicaid_prescription_data

The notebooks in this repository perform exploratory analysis on the data avialable from Medicaid and Medicare website. The data provides valuable information about doctors/practitioners such as their specialty, years of practicing, region, gender etc. It also provides information about the drugs they have prescribed and their counts. Understanding the trends can be very helpful for doctors/practitioners to get information about drugs presrcibed by fellow practioners in their specialty. The data can also be used for drug manufacturers/providers to understand the prescription requirements of each specialty, and may assist them in designing personalized catalog of each individual doctor catering to their needs.
